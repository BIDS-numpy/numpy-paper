  abstract =      {We provide a new version of our ziggurat method for
                   generating a random variable from a given decreasing
                   density. It is faster and simpler than the original,
                   and will produce, for example, normal or exponential
                   variates at the rate of 15 million per second with a
                   C version on a 400MHz PC. It uses two tables,
                   integers ki, and reals wi. Some 99% of the time, the
                   required x is produced by: Generate a random 32-bit
                   integer j and let i be the index formed from the
                   rightmost 8 bits of j. If j < k, return x = j x wi.
                   We illustrate with C code that provides for inline
                   generation of both normal and exponential variables,
                   with a short procedure for settting up the necessary
                   tables.},
