Two different Python array packages existed before NumPy.
The Numeric package began in the mid-90s and provided an array object in
Python, written in C, and linking to standard fast implementations of linear
algebra.
Around 2000, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) software group wrote
a re-implementation of much of Numeric, called NumArray, to support their
need to work on large memory-mapped arrays and arrays of mixed data type
records \cite{STScI-slither}.
This briefly caused the two communities to diverge, until
2005, when NumPy emerged as a ``best of both worlds'' unification of Numeric
and NumArray \cite{oliphant2006guide}.

%By the beginning of the millennium, several libraries built on top of Numeric 
%to provide fundamental scientific routines were combined into SciPy.
%Due to the poor performance of Numeric on large data sets, NumArray was
%developed at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) to handle
%large astronomical images such as those produced by the Hubble Space Telescope.
%However, while initially considered the successor to Numeric, NumArray was no longer
%performant on multiple small arrays.
%This divide posed a challenge for SciPy as it wasn't clear how to support
%both libraries.
%Working with the NumArray and SciPy communities, the then maintainer of Numeric,
%Travis Oliphant, embarked upon a major rewrite that aimed to be a ``best of both
%worlds'' unification of Numeric and NumArray. This merger resulted in NumPy.
%
%The first incarnation of NumPy was a package called Numeric, written in 1995
%by Jim Hugunin, then completing his master's thesis at MIT.
%Hugunin based his package on previous work by Jim Fulton,
%then working at the US Geological Survey, and acknowledges
%many others in his initial report of the package \cite{Hugunin-whitepaper}.
%Later, Paul Dubois at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory toke over the project
%and funded the writing of the first
%manual\footnote{https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2010/slides/travis\_oliphant\_keynote.pdf}.

Today, NumPy underpins almost every Python library that does scientific or
numerical computation including SciPy\cite{virtanen2019scipy},
matplotlib\cite{hunter2007matplotlib}, pandas\cite{mckinney-proc-scipy-2010},
scikit-learn\cite{pedregosa2011scikit}, and
scikit-image\cite{vanderwalt2014scikit}.
It consists of an $n$-dimensional array object along with utility functions
that operate on it.
Because of its inherent simplicity---being a pointer to memory with some
associated meta-data---the NumPy array is
the {\it de facto} exchange format for array data in Python.
The library has such widespread adoption that not only the array object but also its
{\it Application Programming Interface} (API) has become ubiquitous as
a language for array computation.

% S: Maybe we want to emphasize Jax, which has rapidly become very popular

\section*{NumPy arrays}

   }
  \label{fig:array-concepts}
\end{figure*}

The NumPy array is a structure that efficiently stores and accesses
$n$-dimensional arrays, also known as tensors\cite{vanderwalt2011numpy}.
The need for such a data structure arises often in science, as it can be used to represent everything from time-series measurements to time-varying spectral measurements on a grid.

The NumPy array consists of a pointer to memory, along with meta-data used to
interpret the data stored there, notably {\em data type}, {\em shape}, and {\em strides} (see Figure~\ref{fig:array-concepts}).

A {\em data type} describes the nature of elements stored in an array.  An array has a single data type, and each array element occupies the same number of bytes in memory.  Examples of data types include real and complex numbers (of lower and higher precision), strings, timestamps, and pointers to Python objects.

The {\em shape} of an array determines the number of axes, or dimensionality, of the array.  For example, a vector of numbers can be stored as a 1-D array of shape $N$, while color videos are 4-D arrays of shape $T \times M \times N \times 3$.

% shape > num. of axes and number of elements in each axis

{\em Strides} are necessary to interpret computer memory, which stores elements linearly, as $n$-dimensional arrays.  It describes the number of bytes to move forward in memory to jump from row to row, column to column, and so forth.  Consider, for example, a 2-D array of floating point numbers with shape $4 \times 3$, where each element occupies 8 bytes in memory.  To move between consecutive columns we need to jump forward 8 bytes in memory, and to access the next row $3 \times 8 = 24$ bytes.  The strides of that array are therefore $(24, 8)$.

% on top of this structure we add a powerful, expressive syntax for indexing and element-wise
% calculations ....
% this high-level syntax allows us to be efficient (broadcasting) and implement in C for
% optimizing

Portions of an array can be accessed through an {\em indexing} operation.  Arrays can be indexed in several ways to return single elements, sub-arrays, or elements that satisfy a specific condition.  Arrays can even be indexed using other arrays (see Figure~\ref{fig:array-concepts}).  Wherever possible, indexing that retrieves a subarray returns a {\em view} on the original array, such that data is shared between the two arrays.  This provides a powerful way to operate on subsets of array data, while limiting memory usage.

Finally, a powerful array feature that affects the way NumPy indexes and combines arrays, is {\em broadcasting}. When performing an operation (such as addition) on two arrays, one intuitively expect that these arrays should be required to have the same shape.  However, through broadcasting, NumPy allows the dimensions to differ, while still producing results that appeal to intuition.  A trivial example is the addition of a scalar value to an array, but it also generalizes to more complex examples such as scaling each column of an array, or generating a grid of coordinates.  In broadcasting, one or both arrays are virtually duplicated (that is, without copying any data in memory), so that the shapes of the operands match (see Figure~\ref{fig:array-concepts}).  Broadcasting is also applied whenever an array is indexed using arrays of indices.% (see Figure~\ref{fig:broadcasting}).

Once data is viewed as an $n$-dimensional array, more abstract operations such
as reductions (e.g., summation across columns, see Figure~\ref{fig:reductions}) products, and so forth, are
defined.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{static/sketches/reductions}
  \caption{\textbf{Reductions.} \fixme{Reducing an array along one of several axes. Note:
  may want to fix to have right-hand axis system.}
   }
  \label{fig:reductions}
\end{figure}


NumPy includes numerous functions that perform element-wise and reduction operations on arrays, including arithmetic, statistics, and trigonometry.  They aim to loop over array elements near-optimally, taking into consideration, e.g., strides, in order to best utilize the computer's fast cache memory.  Vectorized operations that would take many tens of lines to express in languages such as C can often be implemented as a single, clear Python expression.

Other utility functions include creating, reshaping, concatenating, and padding arrays; searching, sorting and counting data; and reading and writing files.  NumPy provides extensive support for generating pseudorandom numbers and includes an assortment of probability distributions. It also performs accelerated linear algebra, utilising one of several backends such as OpenBLAS and Intel MKL optimized for the CPUs at hand.

Users predominantly interact with NumPy arrays using {\em indexing} (to access sub-arrays or individual elements), {\em operators} (e.g., $+$, $-$, $\times$, and, for matrix multiplication, $@$), together with {\em utility functions}; together, these provide an easily readable, expressive, high-level API (Application Programming Interface) for array manipulation.

% + interactivity
% users tend to "live in their data",
% interactivity and powerful, expressive syntax ... inspect, feel their way forward, experiment
% collect these into imperative or functional programs ....
% not that they never plan, often do ... but the ability to stopping "programming"
% and experiment is a key factor in why people use numpy ....

\section*{Changing computational landscape}

NumPy was initially developed by students, faculty, and researchers in their
spare time to provide a modern array computation library for Python.
They were influenced by their experiences with powerful interactive programming
languages for scientific computing like Yorick \cite{munro1995using} as well
as commercial languages like IDL and Matlab.
Often they developed code to solve their own or their colleagues' problems.

As Python's popularity for scientific computing, data science, and machine
learning increased, many new challenges and use cases arose.

\fixme{The idea here is something like:  classic numpy (as described above)
was built to solve previous problems; new problems have arisen as
the computational landscape has changed; new hardware, new languages,
new problems; as a result np's role has changed; it is a foundational
tool widely-used not a specialist tool used by scientist developers;
many array-like libraries for various uses and np is serving as
a standard)}

- GPUs

- distributed computing

- other languages w/ arrays

- massive explosion in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence

NumPy also went from a small community of mostly expert users to
one of the most widely used foundations of the scientific Python
ecosystem.
Now the user base is very different....
% maybe worth a sentence or two about how we are working on web and
% user docs to make it easier for new users to get started...

\section*{Interoperability and extensibility}

A vast number of projects are built on NumPy;
these projects are consumers of the NumPy API.
Over the last several years, a growing number of projects are providers of
a \emph{NumPy-like API} and array objects targeting audiences with specialized
needs beyond NumPy's capabilities (Figure~\ref{fig:duck-arrays}).
For example, the NumPy API is implemented by several popular tensor computation
libraries including CuPy\footnote{\url{https://cupy.chainer.org/}},
JAX\footnote{\url{https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.numpy.html}},
and Apache MXNet\footnote{\url{https://numpy.mxnet.io/}}.
PyTorch\footnote{\url{https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor\_tutorial.html}}
and Tensorflow\footnote{\url{https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/basics}}
provide tensor APIs with NumPy-inspired semantics.
It is also implemented in packages that support sparse arrays
such as \code{scipy.sparse} and \code{pydata.sparse}.
Another notable example is Dask, a library for parallel computing in
Python.  Dask adopts the NumPy API and therefore presents a familiar
interface to existing NumPy users, while adding powerful abilities to
parallelize and distribute tasks.

\fixme{Similarly there are many projects that build on top of the NumPy API for
labeled and indexed arrays (XArray), automatic differentiation (Autograd,
Tangent), masked arrays (numpy.ma), physical units (astropy.units, pint, unyt),
etc. that add additional functionality on top of the NumPy API. Most of these
project also implement a close variation of NumPy’s level high API.}

The multitude of specialized projects creates the difficulty that consumers
of these NumPy-like APIs write code specific to a single project and do not support
all of the above array providers.
This is a burden for users relying on the specialized array-like, since
a tool they need may not work for them.
It also creates new challenges for end-users who need to transition
from NumPy to a more specialized array.
The growing multitude of specialized projects with NumPy-like APIs threatened
to again fracture the scientific Python community.

\fixme{We would like to be able to use these libraries together, for example we would
like to be able to place a CuPy array within XArray, or perform automatic
differentiation on Dask array code. This would be easier to accomplish if code
written for NumPy ndarrays could also be used by other NumPy-like projects.}

To address these issues NumPy has the goal of providing the fundamental
API for \emph{interoperability} between the various NumPy-like APIs.

For example, a new array protocol was implemented that allows NumPy to consume
array-like objects produced by libraries outside of NumPy.  When asking NumPy
to, e.g., sum such an array, instead of attempting that operation itself, NumPy
requests the original array to complete the computation.  This means that the
NumPy API---the syntax for interacting with arrays---can still be used, but now
with a library that supports GPUs, does distributed computation processing, or
stores data in the cloud.

Another ongoing example is a redesign of the data type system.
While the majority of users rely only on numerical dtypes, there are a
multitude of use cases for which the current implementation is unsuited, such
as physical units\cite{astropy,Goldbaum2018,pint}, geometrical
objects\cite{pygeos}, and automatic differentiation\cite{pyadolc}.
The proposed overhaul of the datatype system will make it behave consistently
and will simplify the creation of custom dtypes, both in C and in Python.


\section*{Discussion}

% aka why is this so successful
% some sense of ongoing work / future directions


The creation of NumPy spurred renewed development in the larger scientific
Python ecosystem and heralded the current era of wide-spread use of Python for
scientific computing.
There were several factors that allowed this rapid growth
and successful development.

Hugunin identified the first factor in his initial description of the Numeric
package \cite{Hugunin-whitepaper}.  Numerical computing is usually one
component of a larger programming task, therefore:
\begin{quote}
    Rather than trying to retrofit an existing numerical language to support
    the wealth of features found in a powerful, modern, general-purpose
    programming language, it makes much more sense to attack the problem from
    the other direction and add the features of a powerful numerical
    programming language to Python.
\end{quote}
Python is already a good choice for many standard programming tasks such as
cleaning data, interacting with web resources and parsing text.  It has a wide
range of libraries for many different tasks. Adding fast array operations and
linear algebra allows the scientist to do all their work with within the same
language---and one that has the advantage of being famously easy to learn and
teach.

The second factor flows from Python's nature as an open-source language,
embedded within the open-source community.  Python attracts developers who like
to build and contribute.  As a result, NumPy has always been a library that was
developed by scientists in order to do their work.  Commercial specialist
numerical languages can encourage consumer-users, who pick up a tool and use
it, but do not expect to contribute to development%<-sentence a bit tough to parse.
In contrast, NumPy often
attracts user-developers, who want to work with NumPy, and are prepared to fix
and extend the library as they work. User-developers have been the fundamental
force in developing NumPy, and shaping it into a library that has been refined
in the furnace of practical scientific work.

The third factor is much like the second: 
%a culture in Python that concentrates
%on high quality of code and distribution.  Because Python is open-source, it has
%a strong culture of contribution, and therefore, of using tools and process to
%improve collaborative software development, such as distributed version
%control, code review, and automated testing.  These have allowed the project to
%scale safely as it attracted more users and developers, even though these
%developers rarely came to the project with training in software engineering.
the project has strong culture of using software-engineering practice to
improve collaboration and reduce error \cite{millman2014developing}.
The NumPy team was early in adopting distributed
revision control and code review to improve collaboration on code, and
continuous testing that runs a large battery of automated tests for every proposed
change to NumPy.
The project has comprehensive, high-quality documentation,
integrated with the source
code\cite{vanderwalt2008scipy,harrington2008scipy,harrington2009scipy}. 

Lastly, we believe NumPy has benefited greatly from a well-chosen application
programming interface (API).  Scientific and numerical programming needs to be
fast, and scale to very large datasets.  The NumPy API defines a simple wrapper
for data in memory so it can be represented as a one- or multi-dimensional
array.  The simplicity of this wrapper has made it very successful as a
standard way of representing arrays in memory, and has made it relatively easy
for other libraries to develop fast and memory-efficient compiled code, usually
in C or Fortran, that can manipulate these arrays and pass them back to Python.
This has been a large factor in the growth of numerical computing libraries
around NumPy and Python.

% S: I think two issues are conflated here: the simple underlying memory model, and the API.  The API has developed organically, while the underlying memory model is a design decision that shapes much of how the rest of the library was built.

% S:
%
% Thinking about enabling factors, I'd characterize them into three categories:
%
% - Practical
% - Philosophical
% - Social
%
% E.g., practical: reason why we use Python (learn one language for everything); students don't have money, so want to avoid impracticalities of license dongles/servers, etc.
%
% Philosophical: science should be open, transparent; our software should be controlled by scientists, not designers that we don't have access to
%
% Social: joy of building these things together, friendly welcome into the community for many of us---appreciation of our work and hours
%
