# Draft of NumPy paper

Stefan brought up the idea of a NumPy paper at the sprint on Friday, Nov. 22,
2019.  Here is a summary of the feedback:

- General interest in doing this, as long as someone takes responsibility for
  leading the process all the way through
- Ideally few initial writers that complete most of the paper, and then opens
  it up for community feedback
- Need to try and wrap it up in a short amount of time, otherwise process
  derails
- What should the content be?
    - History
    - New features?
    - Future developments?
    - Success stories (overlap with SciPy paper?)

Stefan and Jarrod have volunteered to take responsibility for leading this
process through.  To get the process started, we created this repository
and will recruit some additional authors to complete most of the paper.
Once we have something ready to share, we will ask the community for feedback
and transfer this repo to the NumPy organization.  Our goal is to get a
full draft completed by mid- to late-January.

We are following the general outline and authorship policy used for the
recent SciPy paper:  https://github.com/scipy/scipy-articles/tree/master/scipy-1.0
