Dear Federico,

Per your request, we revised our review to address the referees and
to ensure that it is in Nature style throughout.
Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}

% Keep it below 3700 words.

\item We kept the main text well below 3700 words.

\item We changed the title to ``Array Programming with NumPy.''

\item In the abstract, we removed all references,
made clear it is a review article,
ended with a summary sentence,
and stayed under the 200 word limit.

\item We made the methods section into a separate Supplementary Methods PDF
and \textbf{referenced it from the main text.}

\item We annotated the four most significant references and moved URLs from
the references to the text.

\item We created all images specifically for this publication and no
display items in our manuscript are from third parties.

% Please can you complete and sign a copy of the copyright assignment form
% (https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/forms-and-declarations).
% Further information about our copyright assignment policy can be found at

\item \textbf{We completed and signed the copyright assignment form.}

% Our art department will redraw your figures in full colour, but it is important
% that you provide us with detailed and accurate versions of what you require.

\item \textbf{We need to check if they can handle SVG.}

% When resubmitting your revised manuscript, please can you ensure that the file
% is uploaded as a Word or .tex document and it is ordered as main text, tables
% and then figure legends, using the following link

\item \textbf{We uploaded a .tex document ordered as main text, tables and then figure legends.}

\end{enumerate}

### Referee 1

After considering the comments of referee 1, we decided not to make any changes.
The review's aim is not to argue that NumPy is the best array programming library.
We believe it is, but respect people who prefer languages like Matlab and R.
While not a focus of our review, we do briefly mention that there are other
powerful scientific computing environments:
\begin{quote}
The design of this new tool was informed by other
powerful interactive programming languages for scientific computing
such as Basis, Yorick, R, and APL,
as well as commercial languages and environments like IDL and {MATLAB}.
\end{quote}
We also briefly mention new technology:
\begin{quote}
New generation languages, interpreters, and compilers, such as Rust, Julia,
and LLVM, will invent and determine the viability of new concepts and
data structures.
\end{quote}

### Referee 2

We made two changes based on the feedback from referee 2.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Add more background on linear algebra libraries in supplementary methods. \textbf{sebastian}

\item Add more background on PRGs in supplementary methods. \textbf{kevin}

\end{enumerate}

### Referee 3

Referee 3 made some good points that we agree with, but they requested no changes.

Best regards,
