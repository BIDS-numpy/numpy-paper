Dear Federico,

Per your request, we revised our review to address the referees and
to ensure that it is in Nature style throughout.
Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}

% Keep it below 3700 words.

\item We kept the main text well below 3700 words.

\item We changed the title to ``Array Programming with NumPy.''

\item In the abstract, we removed all references,
made clear it is a review article,
ended with a summary sentence,
and stayed under the 200 word limit.

\item We made the methods section into a separate Supplementary Methods PDF
and \textbf{referenced it from the main text.}

\item We annotated the four most significant references and moved URLs from
the references to the text.

\item We created all images specifically for this publication and no
display items in our manuscript are from third parties.

% Please can you complete and sign a copy of the copyright assignment form
% (https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/forms-and-declarations).
% Further information about our copyright assignment policy can be found at

\item \textbf{We completed and signed the copyright assignment form.}

% Our art department will redraw your figures in full colour, but it is important
% that you provide us with detailed and accurate versions of what you require.

\item We uploaded SVG versions of our main figures.  There is one figure in the supplement in PNG format.

% When resubmitting your revised manuscript, please can you ensure that the file
% is uploaded as a Word or .tex document and it is ordered as main text, tables
% and then figure legends, using the following link

\item \textbf{We uploaded a .tex document ordered as main text, tables and then figure legends.}

\end{enumerate}

### Referee 1

Given how widely our philosophical outlook differs from that of referee 1, we cannot incorporate their feedback without substantially altering the gist of our paper.
The aim of our review is not to argue that NumPy is the best array programming library.
We believe it is, but respect the choice of those who prefer languages like Matlab and R.

We could not find support for their statement that "vectorization is known to be hard for new programmers".
While not a focus of our review, we did briefly mention that there are other powerful scientific computing environments:

> The design of this new tool was informed by other powerful interactive programming languages for scientific computing such as Basis, Yorick, R, and APL, as well as   commercial languages and environments like IDL and MATLAB.

We also mentioned new technologies on the horizon:

> New generation languages, interpreters, and compilers, such as Rust, Julia, and LLVM, will invent and determine the viability of new concepts and data structures.

They suggest that code should not have to be rewritten for new hardware; we would be delighted if modern compilers eventually allowed us to do so.

### Referee 2

We addressed the two recommendations made by referee 2: we added more background on linear algebra libraries and random number generation in the supplemental material.  We didn't mention masked arrays as that is a feature we are potentially changing in the near future and wanted to avoid having this articel quickly becoming out-of-date.

\textbf{Linear Algebra.}
We expanded the list of linear algebra functionality provided by NumPy,
referenced LAPACK, and added a sentence about open source software
that preceeded LAPACK.

\textbf{Random Numbers.}
Added text mentioning the three new bit generators we recently added support for
including a link to empirical results testing their statistical soundness and performance.


### Referee 3

Referee 3 made some good points that we agree with, but they requested no changes.
