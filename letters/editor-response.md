Dear Federico,

Thanks again for the careful review and helpful suggestions from you and the referees.
We are very happy that you offered to publish our review article open access
under a CC-BY 4.0 license, at no charge.

Per your request, we revised our review to address the referees and to
ensure that it is in Nature style throughout. Specifically:

1. We kept the main text below 3700 words.

2. We changed the title to ``Array Programming with NumPy.''

3. In the abstract, we removed all references,
made clear it is a review article,
ended with a summary sentence,
and stayed under the 200 word limit.

4. We made the methods section into a separate Supplementary Methods PDF
and referenced it from the main text.

5. We annotated the four most significant references and moved URLs from
the references to the text.

6. We created all images specifically for this publication and no
display items in our manuscript are from third parties.

7. Per your email, we uploaded the final version of our review without
signing the license to publish form.  We are waiting for you to send
another one that includes the right license.

8. We uploaded SVG versions of our main figures.
There is one figure in the supplement in PDF format.

9. We uploaded a .tex document ordered as main text and then figure legends.


### Referee 1

Given how widely our philosophical outlook differs from that of referee
1, we cannot incorporate their feedback without substantially altering
the gist of our paper. The aim of our review is not to argue that NumPy
is the best array programming library. We believe it is, but respect the
choice of those who prefer languages like Matlab and R.

We could not find support for their statement that "vectorization is
known to be hard for new programmers". While not a focus of our review,
we did briefly mention that there are other powerful scientific
computing environments:

> The design of this new tool was informed by other powerful interactive
> programming languages for scientific computing such as Basis, Yorick,
> R, and APL, as well as commercial languages and environments like IDL
> and MATLAB.

We also mentioned new technologies on the horizon:

> New generation languages, interpreters, and compilers, such as Rust,
> Julia, and LLVM, will invent and determine the viability of new
> concepts and data structures.

They suggest that code should not have to be rewritten for new hardware;
we would be delighted if modern compilers eventually allowed us to do
so.

### Referee 2

We addressed the two recommendations made by referee 2: we added more
background on linear algebra libraries and random number generation in
the supplemental material. We didn't mention masked arrays as that is a
feature we are potentially changing in the near future and wanted to
avoid having this article quickly becoming out-of-date.

*Linear Algebra.* We expanded the list of linear algebra
functionality provided by NumPy, referenced LAPACK, and added a sentence
about open source software that preceded LAPACK.

*Random Numbers.* Added text mentioning the three new bit
generators we recently added support for including a link to empirical
results testing their statistical soundness and performance.

### Referee 3

Referee 3 made some good points that we agree with, but they requested
no changes.

Best regards,
