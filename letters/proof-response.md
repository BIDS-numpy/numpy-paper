# Q1.

Display items are correct.  We have uploaded a new version of the
Supplementary Information.

# Q2.

We prefer the `several projects have developed their own interfaces`
construction.  We aren't sure why this construction should be avoided,
so it isn't clear how we should reword it.  The suggested rewording:

"It is so pervasive that several NumPy-like interfaces and array objects
have been developed to better suit the specialized needs of various audiences.‚Äù

is unclear since it removes the phrase 'several projects [...] have developed their own [...]`.
The idea that needs to be conveyed is that several other projects (i.e., not NumPy)
have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects.
That is, the important point is not that several NumPy-like interfaces exist, but
that several projects have developed them.
For instance, we could develop several NumPy-like interfaces ourselves, but that wouldn't
cause the same problems as the situation we are describing does.

# Q3.

We need to send this out ASAP.

# Q4.

Not a question.

# Q5.

I can't tell what they mean by `Author surnames have been highlighted.`
I don't see any highlighting in my PDF viewer.

The names all appear correct.

Will are names link to our ORCID ids?  They did for the SciPy paper.

# Q6.

Changes to supplementary information.

1.  Removed `(Fig.??c)` from the paragraph on ufuncs.  It was supposed
to refer to a figure from the main article, but isn't needed.  As it is,
it is a typo, so we just removed it.

2.  Added the history section that was removed from the main article to
the end of the supplementary information.

In the final edits, we were told:
```
The Acknowledgements section should be for contributions to the present
Review, rather than historical contributions. I have discussed with the editor
and we suggest that you instead include a short historical section in the
Supplementary Information, would that suit? Do let us know if you have another
proposal.
```

We agreed, but the text wasn't added to the Supplementary Information, which
is why we made the change.

# Q7.

The addition of the the EHT collaboration is fine.
