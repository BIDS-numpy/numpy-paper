Dear Federico,

Thank you for your positive response, dated 18 December 2019, to the
presubmission inquiry for our NumPy paper.  Per your request, we have
formatted our submission according to long article limitations.

NumPy is the fundamental Python array programming library.  It has
been developed for 15 years, and is used extensively in scientific
training and research.  NumPy is widely influential, even beyond the
scientific community.  It underpins an ecosystem of numerical Python
libraries that reaches across all disciplines.

Originally, we proposed a paper around NumPy's recent technical
developments and merits.  However, during writing our focus settled on
how NumPy has evolved from an array programming library at the base of
the larger scientific Python ecosystem into also being a mechanism for
using new, specialized array implementations.

We believe that, because of this role as a coordinating mechanism,
NumPy will remain central to scientific computing for the foreseeable
future. This is an important new part of the NumPy story that has
never been told before.

We suggest the following three peer reviewers,
and we do not have any specific reviewer exclusion requests:

- Alan Edelman <<edelman@math.mit.edu>>, co-creator of Julia
    programming language and Professor at MIT.
- Anima Anandkumar <<anima@caltech.edu>>, director of ML research at NVIDIA
    and Professor at Caltech.
- Andrew Chael <<achael@cfa.harvard.edu>>, main developer of eht-imaging
    library and Fellow at Princeton.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

St√©fan van der Walt
