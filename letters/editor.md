# Dear Dr van der Walt,
# 
# Thank you for your enquiry regarding the submission of a manuscript on NumPy to
# Nature. The paper certainly sounds intriguing, and we would be happy to take a
# closer look at it.
# 
# Of course, it is very difficult to make a definitive judgement about a paper
# based only on the limited information available in a presubmission enquiry.
# Therefore I am sure you will understand that we cannot promise to send the
# paper out for peer-review until we have read it in its entirety.  To submit
# your manuscript, please use the following link:

# Before doing so, however, please read your Guide to Authors at

# the paper in perfect Nature style as of yet, it would be ideal if you could
# format it in line with our limitations for long articles - which is to say up

# 
# Feel free to get in touch with me if you'd like to discuss the structure of the
# article further, in case.

# I look forward to reading your manuscript in full.

Dear Federico,

Thank you for your positive response, dated 18 December 2019, to our
presubmission inquiry for a NumPy paper.

As you know, NumPy is the fundamental array computing library for the
Python language.  It underpins an entire ecosystem of numerical Python
libraries, and is estimated to have over 50M users. Its API is used
extensively by a wide variety of tensor processing libraries.

Since NumPy performs no telemetry, it can be difficult to track its
usage.  We could reasonably estimate that 30% or more of all
scientific outputs use NumPy in some part of their processing
pipelines. Even our colleagues in theoretical computer science, who
perform no data analysis, rely on NumPy to provide intuition on
theorems.

In our original letter, we indicated that we wanted to write a paper
about NumPy's recent technical developments and merits.  While writing
the manuscript, it became clear that the focus should be that:

1. NumPy provides an array object ideally suited to scientific
   computing.  It provides an expressive, high-level array programming
   language, that allows powerful concepts to be represented using a
   simple and intuitive syntax.

2. Every field of science now has purpose-built scientific computing
   tools that rely on NumPy.  Many important breakthroughs rely
   heavily on NumPy in their analysis pipelines.

3. With a myriad of modern computational devices, such as GPUs,
   becoming available, NumPy's role has expanded. It is now also a
   coordinating mechanism and unifying layer between new array
   implementations that utilize sophisticated hardware and array
   storage mechanisms.

NumPy has now been developed for 15 years, and builds on a 25 year
legacy. It is used extensively in scientific training and research,
and is widely influential, even beyond the scientific community. We
believe that it warrants publication in a very high-tier journal.

We suggest the following three peer reviewers as suitable candidates,
and we do not have any specific reviewer exclusion requests:

- Alan Edelman <edelman@math.mit.edu>, co-creator of Julia
    programming language and Faculty at MIT.
- William Stein <wstein@gmail.com>, originator and
    lead developer of SageMath.
- Kazunori Akiyama <kazu@haystack.mit.edu>, first author
    of event horizon imaging paper that cites SciPy.
