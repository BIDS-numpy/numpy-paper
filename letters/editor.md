- 25 years since numeric (the precusor to numpy)
- Major work over last few years including array protocol stuff
- no official paper despite over two decades of development and widespread use
- Python 2 EOL

- why did we have so many astronomy examples?  we can provide many more from
  a variety of fields, but these just seemed natural and there is a long
  connection with astronomy

Dear Editor,

NumPy is the fundamental array computing library for the Python
language. It underpins the entire numerical Python ecosystem,
including popular libraries such as SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn,
AstroPy, and many others. It is estimated to have over 50M users, and
its API is used extensively by neural network libraries such as
PyTorch.

We are concluding a 1.3M grant from the Moore and Sloan foundations
to prepare NumPy for the next decade of data science. Over the past
two years, the library has seen several notable additions and
improvements (including extensible random number generators, foreign
array interfaces, and—in progress—a redesign of the underlying
data-type system). Community involvement has also increased
drastically, and we feel that this is a good time to publish a paper
describing the project. We have one previous paper, written by myself
and two other authors from outside the project in 2011.

This time, we would like to involve the community more directly so
that credit can be distributed appropriately. The project is healthy
and growing, with CZI having recently committed several millions to
the scientific Python ecosystem, and specifically NumPy, through
their Essential Open Source Software for Science program.

The "old" paper has ~4500 citations
(with over half in the last two years), and
the new one will likely generate more.
Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Stéfan
