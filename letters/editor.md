- remind them of what we were told i.e., long format
- we focused on array and array protocol

- 15 years since numpy began
- 25 years since numeric (the precusor to numpy)
- Major work over last few years including array protocol stuff
- no official paper despite over two decades of development and widespread use
- Python 2 EOL
- scipy paper out
- sp paper is already in the top 5% of all research outputs ever tracked by Altmetric
in terms of attention and in the top 1% of all Nature Methods papers.

- why did we have so many astronomy examples?  we can provide many more from
  a variety of fields, but these just seemed natural and there is a long
  connection with astronomy
- address difference between what we wrote and what we proposed
  e.g., random number generators

- Developed for over two decades, it has nearly 300,000 dependent repositories on
  GitHub and millions of downloads per year.
- It is one of the most commonly used machine learning tools among

Dear Editor,

Thank you for your positive response, dated 18 December 2019, to our
pre-inquiry for a NumPy paper.

As you know, NumPy is the fundamental array computing library for the
Python language.  It underpins an entire ecosystem of numerical Python
libraries, and is estimated to have over 50M users. Its API is used
extensively by a wide variety of tensor processing libraries.

Since NumPy performs no telemetry, it can be difficult to track its
usage.  We could reasonably estimate that 30% or more of all
scientific outputs use NumPy in some part of their processing
pipelines. Even our colleagues in theoretical computer science, who
perform no data analysis, rely on NumPy to provide intuition on
theorems.

In our original letter, we indicated that we wanted to write a paper
about NumPy's recent technical developments and merits.  While writing
the manuscript, it became clear that the focus should be that:

1. NumPy provides an array object ideally suited to scientific
   computing.  It provides an expressive, high-level array programming
   language, that allows powerful concepts to be represented using a
   simple and intuitive syntax.

2. Every field of science now has purpose-built scientific computing
   tools that rely on NumPy.  Many important breakthroughs rely
   heavily on NumPy in their analysis pipelines.

3. With a myriad of modern computational devices, such as GPUs,
   becoming available, NumPy's role has expanded. It is now also a
   coordinating mechanism and unifying layer between new array
   implementations that utilize sophisticated hardware and array
   storage mechanisms.

NumPy has now been developed for 15 years, and builds on a 25 year
legacy. It is used extensively in scientific training and research,
and is widely influential, even beyond the scientific community. We
believe that it warrants publication in a very high-tier journal.
