% do we use the same process as scipy?  author form?  similar email?

At the last NumPy developer meeting, Stefan raised the
idea of a NumPy paper.  The general sense was that there was interest
in doing this, as long as someone took responsibility for leading the
process all the way through.  It was also suggested that a small group
of people complete most of the paper and then open it up for community
feedback.

Stefan and Jarrod volunteered to take responsibility for overseeing the process with
Stefan.  We recruited Ralf, Sebastian, Kevin, Warren, and Tyler to text and provide
feedback.  It is nearly ready for submission and ....

The draft is currently here:
  https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/numpy-paper/
We plan to transfer this to the NumPy org on GitHub before publication.

We submitted a presubmission inquiry to Nature Methods and they
suggested we try for Nature.  Federico Levi, a senior editor at
Nature, expressed interest.  Without seeing the paper, he couldn't
promise to send it out for peer-review, but asked us to submit it so
he could take a look.
