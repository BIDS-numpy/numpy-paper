We're delighted to tell you that we have a full draft of a NumPy paper,
and we're contacting you as a potential co-author.

Nature responded favorably to our presubmission inquiry and we
will submit the manuscript on Monday, February 17th.
The draft is currently here:
  https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/numpy-paper/
We plan to transfer this to the numpy/archive repo on GitHub closer to publication.
I've also attached a PDF.

Since we intend to submit the manuscript in two weeks, we will need all
co-authors to confirm that their names, affiliations, and addresses are correct no
later than Wednesday the 12th.

We've put a considerable amount of time into the draft and don't anticipate
any big structural changes at this point.  Before submission, we plan to add
a few more sentences to the end of the "Array proliferation and interoperability"
section.  We will also replace the hand-drawn figures with digital versions.
However, we welcome PRs with corrections, minor additions, and wordsmithing.

# Background

At the last NumPy developer meeting, I raised the idea of a NumPy paper.
The general sense was that there was interest in doing this, as long as someone
took responsibility for leading the process all the way through.  It was also
suggested that a small group of people complete most of the paper and then open
it up for community feedback.

Jarrod and I volunteered to take responsibility for composing the manuscript in
consultation with Ralf.  Jarrod took the lead on the overall structure and
content and worked closely with me to draft most of the sections.  Ralf
monitored the process and had multiple phone conversations with us to
refine the outline and content.  The three of us decided on the author
order.  Chuck is the first author given his long-term role as release manager
and one of the project leaders.  We list Travis as the last author to reflect his
role as the original author and his leadership of the scientific Python community.
Jarrod and I next since we did the bulk of the writing and took primary responsibilty
for the paper structure.  Ralf is next as he worked closely with us to refine the manuscript
structure and content.
We went back to ancient history (`git shortlog -sn v0.9.2..HEAD`), and tried to
weigh merge commits (indicative of review effort) and other contributions like
release management, docs, mentoring, and so on to determine the order of the
other authors.  Ralf, Jarrod, and I discussed this at length and believe we
did a reasonable job of ordering authors.  While we are certain not everyone
will be completely happy with the author order, we needed to make some decision.

Best regards,
Stefan
